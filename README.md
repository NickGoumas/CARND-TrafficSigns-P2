# CarND-TrafficSigns-P2
Udacity Traffic Signs Classifier Project 2

This is my second project for the Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree. The task was to use a CNN to identify German traffic signs correctly. I used the LeNet-5 architecture here. The real writeup is with the code in the jupyter notebook here in the repo. It was easier to submit that way. The training, testing and validation data is missing from the repo. It was too large to upload easily. They're referenced in the jupyter notebook as train.p, test.p and valid.p pickle files. 

Here is where the raw dataset can be found: http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset
This won't have the nicely packaged pickle files Udacity provides but it's interesting nonetheless.
